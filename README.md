## Hi, welcome to my GitHub profile!

### About me

Hello, my name is Victor Falcetta, and I am a Swift iOS developer but also develop in other Apple platforms such as Apple TV, Apple Watch and have knowledge on how to use Swift UI. I always strive to learn more and become a better developer than I currently am.

### Current Project
**Currently I am working on** the Open-Source framework called Formworks! Where it is a tool for iOS where you can build forms through a JSON file. You can check it out more about it on its repository below on the pins.

### Worthy mentions (Pinned projects)
- Blink!: It is an Apple TV app where it has a companion iOS app where you can perform Brainstorm sessions with great flow an ease. It is entirely built on Swift UI. **Developed with my teammates [Edgar Sgroi](https://github.com/EdgSgroi) and [Artur Carneiro](https://github.com/csfar)**

- Proativi: It is an iOS app with the focus on to improve your productivity and help you keep track on your tasks. It was one of my first apps that I developed, and I hope to remake it to MVVM pattern and make a proper Core Data usage. **Developed solo**

Feel free to explore my public GitHub repositories! Most of it is exploratory code where I try to learn something but there are a few apps that you can check how my code evolved through time.
